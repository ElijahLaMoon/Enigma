# **Welcome to Enigma!**

### *First of all it's not an exact representation of how Enigma actually works despite it's quite close to it. My code works fine but it misses key settings and notches (I use simplified mechanism which works like odometr), and its result differs from what an actual Enigma would output. Also it has only CLI, GUI to be written. Anyway it works.*
