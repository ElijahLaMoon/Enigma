# **Welcome to Enigma!**

### *First of all it's not an exact representation of how Enigma actually works. My code works fine but it misses key settings, notches (I use simplified example kinda odometr), and its output differs from what actual Enigma would show to you. Anyway it works.*
#

## **HOW TO RUN IT**
### Go into your terminal and run `$ cmake .`, `$ make` and finally `$ ./enigma`
