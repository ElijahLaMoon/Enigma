# **Welcome to Enigma!**

### *First of all it's not an exact representation of how Enigma actually works despitec it's quite close to it. My code works fine but it misses key settings and notches (I use simplified mechanism which works like odometr), and its result differs from what an actual Enigma would output. Anyway it works.*
#

## **HOW TO RUN IT**
## **Linux**
### Go into your terminal and run `$ cmake .`, `$ make` and finally `$ ./enigma`
